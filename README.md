# Pattern Recognition Project

#### This analysis is based on the food production and supply by African countries between 2004 and 2013.

Started off by exploring the production and supply datasets to understand the structure and formats of the data.

Checked for null values and handled the null values accordingly.

Converted the data to the appropriate formats for my ananlyis. It should be noted however, that converted the DATE columns to an Object type along the line given how tricky it got trying to convert whole numbers to datetime format.

Created my viz (visualization) using MATPLOTLIP, SEABORN & PLOTLY.

Imported the geopandas library in other to read the geo-json file.

Analysed and visualized outliers using Boxplots and IQR (Interquartile range).
